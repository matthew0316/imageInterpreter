# imageInterpreter
A program that takes a 28x28 gray scaled image and is able to properly guess and interpret what the image resembles. It is not a one-hundred percent correct program, however, it is a good base line introduction and use of keras, data interpretation, model training, and model testing.

This is not an in-depth or intensive program, it is a baseline use of model creation. It creates a small neaural net and trains the neural net with a dataset from keras.
